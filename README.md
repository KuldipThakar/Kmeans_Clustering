# Kmeans_Clustering
Clustering the MNIST dataset using K-Means for grouping similar handwritten digits without labels.
Clustering the Income dataset using K-Means.

How It Works

**Initialization:**
Decide the number of clusters, k. For example, if you're segmenting customers, you might choose 3 clusters based on spending habits.
Randomly select k points as initial cluster centroids.
**Assignment:**
For each data point, calculate the distance (e.g., Euclidean distance) to each centroid.
Assign each point to the cluster whose centroid is closest.
**Update Centroids**:
Recalculate the centroid for each cluster by finding the mean of all points assigned to that cluster.
**Iterative Optimization:**
Repeat the assignment and update steps until centroids stabilize (i.e., no significant change) or a predefined number of iterations is reached.

**Number of Clusters (k):**__ You choose this based on the problem at hand. Tools like the Elbow Method can help decide the optimal number.

Distance Metric: Euclidean distance is common, but other metrics can be used depending on the data type.

Initialization Method: Random initialization or methods like K-Means++ for better starting points.


**How K-Means++ Works**

Instead of choosing initial centroids randomly, K-Means++ follows these steps:

First Centroid: Select the first centroid randomly from the data points.

Weighted Probability: For each remaining data point, compute the distance to the closest centroid already chosen. The farther a point is from an existing centroid, the higher its chance of being selected as the next centroid.

Repeat: Continue this process until k centroids are selected.

Proceed with K-Means: Use these centroids as the starting point for the standard K-Means algorithm.
